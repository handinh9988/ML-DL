# ML-DL 
    - In this branch is 4 assignments of Neural Networks and Deep Learning by Andrew Ng.
    - Just in case you need some help, take a look from the files and go get your certificate ðŸ˜‰
- Here the link to the course https://www.coursera.org/learn/neural-networks-deep-learning/home/welcome, which is the first course in the Deep Learning Specialization program.
- I'm currently on the 2nd Course of Improving Deep Neural Networks: Hyperparameter Tuning, Regularization and Optimization.
- So.. Wish me luck on finishing the program âœ¨ðŸ’—
