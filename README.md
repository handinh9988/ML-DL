Main branch contains Python basic tutorial files in CS225N ✨
- You can practice directly from Google Colab Notebook through this URL https://colab.research.google.com/github/cs231n/cs231n.github.io/blob/master/python-colab.ipynb#scrollTo=fY12nHhyL9hX (which is free, cloud-based with all pakages set-up and ready to run). 
- Or you can run it on Jupyter from your machine, with some environment and packages setting (Anaconda recommended).
    - Step1: Download the Jupyter file from CS231n repositories https://github.com/cs231n/cs231n.github.io/blob/master/jupyter-notebook-tutorial.ipynb or python-colab.ipynb file in the main branch.
    - Step2: Setup your environment as follow in https://cs231n.github.io/setup-instructions/.
    - Step3: Run the code and study with me 👌💪😇😍
 Goodluck on your learning journey, hope you all have a great start 🌟🌟💗💗✨✨
